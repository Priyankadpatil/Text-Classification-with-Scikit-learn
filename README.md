# Text-Classification-with-Scikit-learn

## Data
For our data, we're going to work with the 20 Newsgroups data set, a classic collection of text documents that is often used as a benchmark for text classification models. The set contains texts about various topics, ranging from computer hardward to religion. Some of the topics are closely related to each other (such as "IBM PC hardware" and "Mac hardware"), while others are very different (such as "religion" or "hockey"). The 20 Newsgroups comes shipped with the Scikit-learn machine learning library, our main tool for this exercise. It has been split into training set of 11,314 texts and a test set of 7,532 texts.
